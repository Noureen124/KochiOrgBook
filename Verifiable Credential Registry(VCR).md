**Verifiable Credential Registry(VCR)**
>provides a standard way to express credentials on the Web in a way that is cryptographically secure, privacy respecting, and machine-verifiable.
>A verifiable credential can represent all of the same information that a physical credential represents.
>It can be considered as a database where all VCs reside.
>In KOB, VCs of registered entity is going to reside with a set of API calls for performing various tasks.

**Roles and Informationn for this specification**
1.Issuer
2.Holder
3.Verifier
4.Verifiable Data Registry


**CHALLENGES of current state of identity in internet**
>paper credential model
>User IDs/passwords are the norm, but they are a pain to use, and as a result, are susceptible to attack
>Other personal information and identifiers we have that we could otherwise use to prove our identity are not trusted because it's impossible to tell if the data was actually issued to the person entering it

**Solutions**
>-self-sovereign identity (SSI) and trust over IP (ToIP)
>The Hyperledger projects, Indy, Aries and Ursa,are tools and libraries that allow for the development of independent digital identities rooted on blockchains or other distributed ledgers. They help bring about the possibility of building applications with a solid digital foundation of trust by enabling the verifiable credentials model.
